# Using `direnv`

[`direnv`](https://www.direnv.net) allows you to specify particular actions your shell
will perform when entering or exiting a particular directory.

This tutorial will give you an overview of how to set up `direnv` on the
various supercomputers that `AWI-ESM` currently is running on. As always, a
video guide as well as text documentation is provided.
